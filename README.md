This is our copy of the TAS-B based BERT(Dot) retrieval model. 

The code for training the model is present in the training model folder. 
Afer training we created .py file where we could import the pre-trained model and directly pass the inputs and the outputs for an ease. 
From hereon, we intend to use this file for performing experimentations.
